# Pre-requisites
* NodeJS 12.6.0/14.15.4/16.10.0
* npm

# How to run the code

We have provided scripts to execute the code. 

Use `run.sh` if you are Linux/Unix/macOS Operating systems and `run.bat` if you are on Windows.  Both the files run the commands silently and prints only output from the input file `sample_input/input1.txt`. You are supposed to add the input commands in the file from the appropriate problem statement. 

Internally both the scripts run the following commands 

 * `npm ci --silent` - This will build the solution downloading the necessary dependencies.
 * Once the `npm install` from the previous build process is complete, we will execute the program using the command

`npm start --silent sample_input/input1.txt`
